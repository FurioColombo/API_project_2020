# API_project_2020
Algorithms and Principles of Informatics Project 2020 - Optimized CLI Text Editor

The main.c opens a CLI based text editor with a few possible commands, such as writing, deleting and undoing an arbitrary number of commands.
The project was completed in about a week of consecutive work in the summer 2020, being then revisited and controlled, cleaning a bit the code before publishing and submitting the code for evaluation.

The C file only only relies on few standard C libraries, which are usually provided in any base C install, the list in detail: 
-stdio.h
-string.h
-malloc.h
-stdbool.h
-stdlib.h
